## TCPLightingWebInterface-MQTT - Can be used with MQTT & IFTTT
This is a fork of the fabulous TCPLightingWebInterface (https://github.com/bren1818/TCPLightingWebInterface) created by bren1818.

This fork aims to remove cloud dependance by leveraging MQTT. While leaving the IFTTT focused API available. 

This is acheived through an additional python script (generated as needed by a PHP script), a couple cron jobs and a small API change 

Setup is as described in the project's wiki - https://github.com/sktaylortrash/TCPLightingWebInterface-MQTT/wiki
